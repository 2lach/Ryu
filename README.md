# Ryu

## About:

### work in progress

Ryu is a simplification of Rsync
Well if you wanna be particular and shit it's a wrapper around rsync with
some built in options that I find useful.
At the end of the day I made this because rsync is an awesome tool!
But sometimes all those rsync options can become complex and hard to remember.
So Ryu makes rsync less complex, cause sometimes it would be nice if life was more like
street fighter, smash some buttons, kick some ass and enjoy a victory.

* Warning rant-alert
And if you are one of those people that reads way to much into what i wrote on the lines above, such as:
you interpret that as if i meant is that is it okey to kick peoples ass from time to time. Well, then you are just a jackass looking for an excuse be a jackass. And since i can't stop you from being whop you are (if that in fact is a jackass) that would be your issue, not mine.
I will not condole any type of violence, hateful behavior, speeches or slurs, none any of that shit!
